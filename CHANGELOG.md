## 0.2.0 - 2018-04-02

Huge shotout to @jonasbleyl who discovered a whole swath of hardware metrics that can be reported!

* Report sub-hardware sensors. For those missing motherboard temperatures, fan controllers, and voltage metrics -- those should now be reported.
* Change logging of sensors without a value from warning to debug as fan controllers often don't have a value and we want to prevent log spam.

## 0.1.3 - 2018-03-07

* Increase logging done under `DEBUG` to aid diagnostics
* Ease upgrades by packing everything into `OhmGraphite.exe`. No need for the .dll files anymore. Upgrading now consists solely of replacing the executable.
